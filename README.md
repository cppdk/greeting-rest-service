# greeting-rest-service

## Introduction

A simple rest service that is developed towards being able to greet you in a 
number of languages. Currently it will only greet you with a "Hallo" which is
the Danish, Swedish or Norwegian way to say "Hello". Currently it is perceived
as a Danish greeting and the only supported greetings are Danish and English.

## Worth Noticing

The initial resource "/greetings" is now only supported using a 
  
    application/json

content-type, where the more semantical correct "/greetings" is supported for
a period of time for compliancy by setting the Accept header to 

    application/hal+json

This is mainly done to show how coexistence thus moving along is possible. 
Furthermore the resource "/greetings/{greeting}" is now made with the content
version scheme using "application/hal+json" as producer content-type and 
showing how to use the actual version of content. 

    application/hal+json;concept=greeting;v=1

if a consumer has the need to go back to that version, once a version 2 e.g. 

    application/hal+json;concept=greeting;v=2

is created in a near future.

## Working with the service

Underneath there are a collection of useful things to work with using the
